# Movie Box Office Rankings

This HTML document displays a table showing the top 25 highest-grossing movies of all time, along with their respective ranks, release years, titles, and box office earnings.

## Table Structure

The table consists of five columns:

1. Rank
2. Year
3. Title
4. Box Office Earnings

Each row represents a movie entry, with the top row (`tr`) being the header row (`th`) containing the column names.

## Styling

The table utilizes basic styling through an external CSS file (`style.css`). The CSS file contains rules for font size, font family, font weight, and border styles.

## External CSS

The document links to an external CSS file (`style.css`) for additional styling. This file contains styling rules for the table, table header (`th`), table rows (`tr`), and specific rows (`#top` and `#bottom`) to control border radius.

## Usage

To view the table with its styling, simply open this HTML file in a web browser.
